# Bucket of Wet Slop

"The world is in turmoil and people are in pain. Even still, we can take comfort in knowing that there is bucket of wet slop. Grins."<br> \- Someone (I couldn't be bothered looking up who said this)

### What does this mod do?
 This mod adds a Bucket of Wet Slop. That's it.<br>
Absolutely prefectly safe slop that won't poision the surrounding environment!

### Where can I find this slop?
 The slop does not appear naturally in the world and instead must be crafted with a *Slime Block*, *Water Bucket* and *Empty Bucket*. The empty bucket is in the recipe because it's not worth writing an entire custom crafting system just to prevent the water bucket from leaving a second empty bucket behind.
